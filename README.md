# Scientific Calculator
A simple scientific calculator made with C++ as a project for our third semester course.

# Reason for choosing this as a project
<h5>We built this as a project for our third semester course on C++ and Java. This is a scientifc calculator using which you </h5>
Scientific calculators have replaced the traditional mechanical sliders that were used in calculations in earlier times for solving maths and engineering problems.
Most commonly slide rule was an analog computer used to find out roots, logarithms, trigonometry calculus, sliding rules by hand. However, with the advent of scientific calculators, a lot of manual work has been automated.
There have been a lot of projects on scientific calculator done earlier, but those were only limited to arithmetic problems.

<b>In our calculator we have used linear algebra and matrix calculator too. This makes it unique.</b>
